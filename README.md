Coding exercises from the fundamentals of computing courses from Rice University

As I'm going through the coursera series on Fundamentals of Computing, I'll collect some of my exercises here.

Some will be for later enhancement, whereas some will likely stay the way they are. My personal goal is to simply get some more hands-on time in Python, as I'm just not doing enough codings as a Sr. SWE Manager to keep me happy.

This Specialization covers much of the material that first-year Computer Science students take at Rice University, brought to you by the world-class Faculty who teach our master's and PhD programs. Students learn sophisticated programming skills in Python from the ground up and apply these skills in building more than 20 fun projects.  The Specialization concludes with a Capstone exam that allows the students to demonstrate the range of knowledge that they have acquired in the Specialization.
